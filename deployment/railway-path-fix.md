# Railway Path Fix

## 🚨 Issue Fixed: Incorrect Directory Paths

The build was failing because:
- **Root nixpacks.toml** was using `cd ../server` 
- **From root directory**: `../server` doesn't exist
- **Correct path**: `./server` or just `server`

## ✅ Solution Applied

I've fixed the directory paths in the root `nixpacks.toml`:

### **Before (❌ Broken):**
```toml
[phases.install]
cmds = [
  "cd common && npm install",
  "cd ../server && npm install"  # ❌ Wrong path
]

[phases.build]
cmds = [
  "cd common && npm run build",
  "cd ../server && npm run build"  # ❌ Wrong path
]
```

### **After (✅ Fixed):**
```toml
[phases.install]
cmds = [
  "cd common && npm install",
  "cd server && npm install"  # ✅ Correct path
]

[phases.build]
cmds = [
  "cd common && npm run build",
  "cd server && npm run build"  # ✅ Correct path
]
```

## 🎯 Why This Works

When building from the **root directory**:
- ✅ `cd common` → Goes to `./common/`
- ✅ `cd server` → Goes to `./server/`
- ❌ `cd ../server` → Tries to go to `../server/` (doesn't exist)

## 📋 Build Process Now

1. **Setup**: Install Node.js 18 and npm 9
2. **Install**: 
   - `cd common && npm install`
   - `cd server && npm install`
3. **Build**: 
   - `cd common && npm run build`
   - `cd server && npm run build`
4. **Start**: `cd server && node dist/index.js`

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Commit and push** these changes
2. **Redeploy** your Railway service
3. **The build should now succeed** with correct paths

Your EchoBoard application should now deploy successfully! 🎉
