# Railway Node.js Version Fix

## ðŸš¨ Issue Fixed: npm Version Compatibility

The build was failing because:
- **Railway uses**: Node.js 18.20.5 with npm 9.x
- **We tried to install**: npm@latest (11.6.0) which requires Node.js 20.17.0+

## âœ… Solution Applied

I've removed the `npm install -g npm@latest` command from all Nixpacks configurations because:

1. **Railway already provides**: npm 9.x which is compatible with Node.js 18
2. **No need to upgrade**: npm 9.x works perfectly for your project
3. **Avoids version conflicts**: Prevents engine compatibility issues

## ðŸ”§ Updated Configurations

### Root `nixpacks.toml`:
```toml
[phases.setup]
nixPkgs = ["nodejs-18_x", "npm-9_x"]

[phases.install]
cmds = [
  "cd common && npm install",
  "cd ../server && npm install"
]

[phases.build]
cmds = [
  "cd common && npm run build",
  "cd ../server && npm run build"
]

[start]
cmd = "cd server && node dist/index.js"
```

### Server `server/nixpacks.toml`:
```toml
[phases.setup]
nixPkgs = ["nodejs-18_x", "npm-9_x"]

[phases.install]
cmds = [
  "cd ../common && npm install",
  "cd ../server && npm install"
]

[phases.build]
cmds = [
  "cd ../common && npm run build",
  "cd ../server && npm run build"
]

[start]
cmd = "node dist/index.js"
```

## ðŸš€ Next Steps

1. **Commit and push** these changes to your repository
2. **Redeploy** your Railway service
3. **The build should now succeed** without npm version conflicts

## ðŸŽ¯ Why This Works

- âœ… **Uses Railway's npm**: No version conflicts
- âœ… **Node.js 18**: Compatible with your project
- âœ… **npm 9.x**: Sufficient for all your dependencies
- âœ… **Simplified build**: Removes unnecessary npm upgrade step

## ðŸ“‹ Build Process Now

1. **Setup**: Install Node.js 18 and npm 9
2. **Install**: Install dependencies for common and server
3. **Build**: Build common package, then server
4. **Start**: Run `node dist/index.js`

Your EchoBoard application should now deploy successfully! ðŸŽ‰
